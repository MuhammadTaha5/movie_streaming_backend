# üé¨ Movie Streaming Platform Backend

A MongoDB-based backend system for a movie streaming platform that manages movies, users, watch history, and reviews.  
Includes search (keyword, fuzzy, semantic search and hybrid ranking) and analytics using aggregation queries. Also the endpoints to insert, analyze different things.

üìò Overview
## üß© Overview
The system provides backend functionality for a movie streaming platform like Netflix.  
It manages movies, users, and user interactions (watch history, reviews), and supports:
- Keyword-based search (title, director, cast)
- Fuzzy matching for typo-tolerant search
- Hybrid ranking based on similarity, rating, and popularity
- Finding average movie rating with numbers of reviews.

‚öôÔ∏è Features
## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- CRUD operations for Movies, Users, and Reviews
- Track user watch history
- Full-text search with typo tolerance(Fuzzy Search to make efficient Searches)
- Hybrid ranking based on similarity, rating, and popularity
- Aggregation-based analytics (e.g., Top 5 most-watched movies)


## üß† System Design
The database uses four main collections:

- **movies** ‚Üí Stores movie information with nested genres and cast.
- **users** ‚Üí Stores user details and subscription type.
- **watchHistory** ‚Üí Records user activity (movie watched, timestamp, duration).
- **reviews** ‚Üí Stores user ratings and text reviews for movies.

**Relationships:**
- One user ‚Üí many reviews
- One movie ‚Üí many reviews and watch history entries


## üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema
The database uses four main collections:

- **movies** ‚Üí Stores movie information with nested genres and cast.

### üìö **Indexing Strategy**

Indexes are created to optimize search and aggregation performance across collections.

* **Movies:** Text index on `title`, `director`, `cast.name` + indexes on `genres`, `rating.average`, `popularity`.
* **Users:** Unique index on `email`, and index on `name`.
* **Reviews & WatchHistory:** Indexes on `movie_id`, `user_id`, and `timestamp` for faster lookups and analytics.


###  **üåê API Design**
API endpoints

```markdown
## üåê API Design

### 1. GET `/movies/search?query=...`
Searches movies by title, director, or cast with typo tolerance.
Plus it rank by calculating similarity score on Title, director, and cast. It gives final ranking by summation of title, cast, director score.

**Parameters:**
#For Keyword Search
- `query` (string): Search keyword
<!-- http://127.0.0.1:8000/search?title=hell&director=smith&cast=tom -->

First it do regex and then fuzzy search for calculating distance with stored values.
Then it rank accordingly.

**Response Example:**
```json
[
  {
    "title": "The Godfather",
    "rating": 9.2,
    "popularity": 250
  }
]

### 2. Similarity search (typos like "Godfathe" ‚Üí "The Godfather")
endpoint designed: "/movies/title/{title}"
// http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies/title/hell%20of%20japan

Title embedding already stored in services/semanticTitleModel
These are titleSearchSearch controls the logic behind.

### 3. Hybrid Search
Title similarity is done by semantic search it goes score in range (0-1)
Average Rating, Popularity which is under out of 100(Average rating) is normalized and in the same manner as title search.
 
endpoint Designed: "/movies/hybrid/{title}"
// http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies/hybrid/devil
